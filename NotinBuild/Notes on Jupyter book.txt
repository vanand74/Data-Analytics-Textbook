I found the Jupyter Book documentation most helpful. Everything I needed was in the "Create your first book" section. 
Jupyter notebook official documentation: https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html

These websites were somewhat useful:

https://chrisholdgraf.com/jupyter-book/intro.html

I had to customize the config.yml file. Through this, I excluded a folder from the book build, specified the location of my repository on GitHub, and told the jupyter-book build process to allow errors. In the official documentation, there's a page on how to customize this file:
https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/customize/config.html

Here's a link to a config.yml file at a GitHub repository:
