    "Now that you understand some basic Python coding, we can show you the real power of data analytics. The goal of data analytics is to extract meaningful information from large amounts of data. One way to present the insights found in data analytics is through visualization. Visualization is just a fancy word for representing your data in a visual format through graphs, charts, pictures, etc. While analyzing data is important, the goal of data analytics is to answer questions and provide information to another party. Visualizations help convey the important information in an easily digestible format. \n",

To do this, you can present the allocation of your investment portfolio in a variety of ways. Below we present the same information twice. Which presentation of the data more easily allows you to understand the composition of your portfolio?"

There are two kinds of questions you should ask. The first and most important question you should answer is \"_what is the purpose of my visualization?_\" The first set of questions presented here will help you pick a visualization based on this important question. After you have gone through these questions you will probably have narrowed down the possible visualizations. Other important questions relate to the data you have available. Some visualizations require certain types of data. Therefore the second set of questions relates to the data available and what visualizations are possible with your data constraints. "
