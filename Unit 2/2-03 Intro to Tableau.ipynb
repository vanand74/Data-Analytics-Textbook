    "Tableau is commercial (i.e., you must pay for it) software that helps you to easily create professional looking visualizations. Although Tableau allows you to create visualizations with the click of a button, this ease of use comes with a huge drawback. _It is so easy to click and drag variables, that if you do not understand exactly what you want your end product to be, it is easy to end up with a visualization that is not very useful or even worse completely wrong!_\n",
    "\n",
    "This drawback is why the unit is structured to teach you how to create the detailed parts of each visualization in Python before jumping into a software designed for visualization. With the knowledge you gained from creating visualizations from scratch, you will now be a much more powerful user of Tableau, which will be incredibly useful in the workplace. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready to create a visualization, you should first make a guess about how the visualization will appear. In other words, you should have an expectation before you create a graph. After you create the graph, it should not surprise you. If it does, then you should check whether you created the graph correctly. If you just create a visualization without thinking first, your resulting graph is likely to be wrong.\n",

    "This section will cover how to create each of the eight visualization types discussed earlier in the unit. The next section introduces you to some basic aspects of Tableau, so if you are familiar with Tableau, you can skip ahead to the following section."

    "Tableau takes your variables and categorizes them as either dimensions or measures. \n",

    "Measures are quantitiative values. Measures have numeric data and each number represents its value. Measures can be aggregated. That is, you can obtain the sum of a measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau sometimes confuses measures and dimensions. For example, item numbers or identification numbers will sometimes be imported as measures, even though they are dimensions. Tableau does this because it sees numerical data and interprets this as quantitative values that can be summed, but with item numbers the numerical values cannot be aggregated. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert between dimensions and measures by right clicking on the variable and choosing \"convert to dimension\" or \"convert to measure\" whichever you intend to convert the variable to. You can also click on a variable and drag it from one category to the other. \n",

    "Depending on which version of Tableau you have downloaded on your computer, your data tab might look slightly different. Older versions of Tableau separate dimensions and measures more clearly. In the image above dimensions and measures are separated by a grey line. In the image, Dimensions are above the grey line (Company and Measure Names), and Measures are below the grey line (Profit, Revenue (in millions), Sheet1 (Count), Measure Values). If you convert a dimension to a measure or a measure to a dimension the item will move to the other side of the grey line. "

    "Though it is hard to see in the screenshot above, each variable is either green or blue. The color indicates whether the variable is discrete or continuous. Blue indicates a discrete field and green indicates a continuous field. Tableau treats continuous and discrete fields differently. For example, when you use a discrete field as a row or a column, each unique data item in the field is listed as the columns or rows, so you see the name of each data item. When you use a continuous field as a row or a column, an axis is displayed from the lowest amounts to the highest amounts in your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time Tableau correctly assigns your variables as either discrete or continuous; however if your data is not doing what you intend it to do, this would be something to check for. Similar to above, one common example of when Tableau mixes up the discrete and continuous variables is when it is dealing with numerical ID numbers like SKUs, item numbers, or any numerical representation of an individual person/item. Because numerical ID numbers seem like they can be aggregated and added together, Tableau assigns this as continuous. However, item number 27184 is not greater than item number 302, and you cannot aggregate the item numbers to be anything meaningful. Therefore these are actually discrete variables. \n",

    "The exact steps for making a visualization depend on how your data is organized. The first step is to make sure your variables are correctly imported into Tableau (use the Data Source tab), and the second step is to have an idea in mind for what you want the visualization to look like. Tableau is useful software, but it can create visualizations that look different than you intend; therefore, having a visualization in mind ahead of time is important for ensuring you obtain the appropriate visualization.

Sometimes this is not available, so you need to create the visualization using the Marks box next to the data section.\n",
