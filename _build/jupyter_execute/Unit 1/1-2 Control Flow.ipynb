    "When many people think of programming, they think of `if` statements. `if` statements are the heart of logic. Instructions given to another person, or to a computer, often depend on a condition. For example, say you are writing a grocery shopping list to give to someone else. You want raspberries, but only if they look delicious and are not too expensive. You could write the raspberry portion of your shopping list as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (raspberries look good) and (raspberry price < $4.00):\n",

We could also use the word `or`, but that would change the logic. Joining the conditions with an `or`, as we do below, would instruct your personal shopper to buy raspberries if they are good-looking or if they are cheap. With an `or`, you would only forgo raspberries if they are bad-looking and expensive.\n",

And say that your third choice is apples, and you don't care whether the apples look good or are pricey. You could modify your shopping list as follows:\n",
