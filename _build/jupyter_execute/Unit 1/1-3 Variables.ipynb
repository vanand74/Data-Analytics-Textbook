    "One of the fundamental ideas in programming is that your code executes inside an _environment_. An environment is a container for all of your variables. The _state_ of your environment is simply a list of all your variables _and their values_. When you first opened this notebook, there were no user-defined variables in your environment so you had an \"empty\" environment. If you execute any of the example code below, Python will create variables and save them in your environment. These variables, and the entire environment, will be deleted when you close this notebook.\n",

Then, open the JupyterLab debugger by clicking on the bug button in the top right of your JupyterLab window (it is on the right side of the toolbar that has the save button, and should be to the left of the words Python 3 (ipykernel)). A new pane will open on the right side of your JupyterLab window. At the top of the pane, next to the word Globals, there are two buttons. If you hover over one, it will say \"Tree View\". If you hover over the other, it will say \"Table View\". Make sure the Table View button is selected. Now to the left of the word Globals, you will see the word VARIABLES. Click the arrow to the left of VARIABLES to expand the list of variables. In the box beneath this button, you will see the values of system variables that Python created. Now, type the code from the following cells into new cells in your notebook. Run each, one at a time, and watch the changes in your debugger."
