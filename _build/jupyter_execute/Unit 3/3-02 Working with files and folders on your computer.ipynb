    "In prior years, we found that many students did not understand how files are organized on their computers. This caused myriad problems. One common problem was that students would download a Jupyter notebook from Compass, move it to a folder, and work on it. A few days later, they would download the notebook again. They had two (or more) copies of a notebook and did not realize. They would open one notebook and wonder where their work had gone, not realizing they had a second copy of the notebook elsewhere on their computer. Another common problem was that they had difficulty opening files in Python because they did not understand the concept of a path.\n",
