    "In this unit, and the rest of this course, we will use Python's Pandas library. Pandas is one of the best and most commonly used packages for working with data. Pandas is an acronym that stands for \"panel data\". The term [panel data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data) comes from economics and refers to datasets that contain observations over multiple time periods for the same entity. Pandas was originally developed by someone working with financial data and has since grown in size and scope to be an excellent, general-purpose library for manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas will be your \"go to\" library when working with data in Python. Typically, you will load your data into Pandas, clean it, manipulate it, and aggregate it, all in Pandas. You may use other libraries for plotting or statistical analysis, but the bulk of your work will be done in Pandas. "

    "Before we dive into the details, let's talk about the reasons to use Pandas (or any other serious data manipulation library). The big reason to choose Pandas over Excel or Tableau Prep is that _Pandas makes it easy to reproduce your work_. With Pandas, you must write declarative code statements. You're telling the computer exactly what you want it to do with your data. When you are done, you can view those steps. In other words, you can _audit your work_. That is not possible with Excel. In the past, after our students have completed big Excel projects, we ask them what steps they took. They usually don't remember. If they had to reproduce their work, it would take them hours. This is problematic because they cannot determine whether they did their work correctly. Pandas, by nature, is easily auditable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage over Excel is _speed_. When you have to work with hundreds of thousands, or millions, of rows, Excel will become very slow. Pandas will be much faster."

    "Pandas is a very powerful, but very complex library. It has myriad features and we will only teach you a small subset of those features. While we will show you most of what you need to know to complete the assignments for ACCY 570, it is likely you will need to learn new features when using Pandas on your own. Even in ACCY 570, it might not be obvious how to perform a task in Pandas. When you find yourself in that situation, you will likely start searching on the web.\n",
