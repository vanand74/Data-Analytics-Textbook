The official documentation for the Pandas `read_excel` function is [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html). You can also do a Google search for \"Pandas read csv\" and the first link will be to the same page. Take a look at that page and browse the available arguments. You'll see that `read_csv` offers a lot of features, especially for dealing with dates, missing data, and Excel error values."
