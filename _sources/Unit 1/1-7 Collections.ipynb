If you don't care, skip this paragraph. :) In early programming languages, like C, programmers had to manage the computer's memory. To write C code, you had to think like a computer. The name of a list is the memory address (called a \"pointer\") of the first element. The index is an \"offset\". It tells C to start at the memory address of the first element and move forward. Thus, in C, `employees[2]` tells the computer to locate the memory address of the first element of employees and go forward by 2 elements. That gives the memory address of the third element. If you want the first element, `employees[0]` tells the computer to locate the memory address of the first element and go forward by 0 elements.\n",

    "We want to make you aware of tuples because many Python functions require tuples as arguments. One plotting function allows you to specify the size of the figure you want to create; the argument, `figsize` must be a tuple containing the width and height. Some functions will return tuples. For example, the Pandas DataFrame is a table of data. Pandas will tell you the \"shape\" of a DataFrame: its shape method returns a tuple containing the number of rows and the number of columns. \n",
